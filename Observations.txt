1. It was strange to find certain values of years in the format other than(YYYY), 
like some tv shows or a movie 1000 years in the making!
2. The distribution of ratings is far from Gaussian with many values on the higher side as is evident
 by the median(3.23). 
This would have made the problem interesting if the 20/20/20 split would have been done on the ratings rather than the movies.
3. Applying various classification methods did not improve much of the accuracy.
4. Tinkering with the train test split gave the best results at the 70-30 mark
